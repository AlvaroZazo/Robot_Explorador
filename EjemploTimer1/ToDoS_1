**1ยบ TASK**

  Use the first example code and extend it with a Qt QTimer object from
  the Qt repertory of classes to activate the counter, through Qt's signals
  and slots mechanism.
  
  
  
**2ยบ TASK**

  Study the solution proposed in the second example where a custom Timer class is implemented  
  using only the std library.
  
  Complete the example adding methods to change the period, obtain 
  the current period or obtain the elapsed time since the Timer was initiated. 
  Be careful with variables accessed from two threads. 
  
  Comment in the provided code before     
  uploading to GitHub how do the methods in Timer.h work and why those instructions are used.

Make creative changes and improvements to the three examples and expose them when evaluated in the classroom. Upload the three programs to your GitHub account.
